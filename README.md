Week 1 challenge: Refractor code

This was a short exercise in code refractoring.

I used CSS and HTML semantics to simplify the redundant parts of the code.

I refractored this code to learn how to keep it simple - not everything has to be difficult.

The main problem that this exercise solves is that I left in the redundant code but commented it out. I only left in the relevant parts. It's, in my opinion, a good example of how one can be redundant in the coding world.

My main takeaway was a firm understanding of Github and how it works. Another key takeaway for me was how easy it can be to make your own work harder for yourself.

A wise man once said "Keep it simple, stupid!" and this is a prime example, in my eyes.
